                    MINNESOTA GOVERNMENT DATA PRACTICE ACT NOTICE. This notice is given pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, Sections ยง13.04, Subd. 2, and ยง13.41,
                    Subd. 2. The Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Health (Commissioner) will use information provided in this application to
                    determine if you meet Minnesota Statutes Chapter 146B requirements for licensing. You are not legally required to supply the requested
                    information. However, FAILURE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION OR THE SUBMISSION OF FALSE OR MISLEADING INFORMATION MAY DELAY THE PROCESSING OF
                    YOUR APPLICATION OR MAY BE GROUNDS FOR DENYING YOUR APPLICATION. All data, except your name and address, submitted by you or on your
                    behalf are considered private until you are licensed. "Private" data is data that is not public and is accessible to you. When you
                    become licensed, the application data except social security number becomes public. Information submitted to the Commissioner in this
                    licensing application may, in some circumstances, be disclosed to other persons or entities including the Minnesota Department of Health
                    and its staff, staff of the Attorney General's office; and persons whom they contact including any person to whom the Commissioner must
                    refer the application or parts thereof for verification purposes or for otherwise determining your qualifications, and to persons you
                    designate. In addition, if the matter of your license becomes contested and results in a contested case hearing or litigation, the data
                    submitted by you or on your behalf may also become accessible to the Minnesota Office of Administrative Hearings, appropriate courts,
                    and those associated with such proceedings, and thereby become public data.
